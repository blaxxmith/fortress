# Fortress

_A simple password safe, written in Rust._

## Concepts

You must define a master password, which will be used to encrypt the vault.
Each time you want to use the vault, you will be asked for this password.

First, create a vault file (by default it will create the vault at `/tmp/vault.frt`):

```sh
frtrs create
```

Then, add entries to the vault (see docs to know more about the arguments):

```sh
frtrs add <identifier> --username <username> --password <password>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If none of the password methods are provided (neither `-p` nor `-g`), the password will be the content of the \*
> \*clipboard\*\*

## Security Principles

- The master password is not stored
- We are using only well-known methods and libraries
- Strict checks and tests before releases
- Independent code audit

## Installation

### Quick with Nix Flakes

```sh
nix run github:/xavier2p/fortress
```

### Build

> [!Note]
> This project requires Rust 1.56+ to build.

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xavier2p/fortress && cd fortress
```

2. Install the binary

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> For Flake utilization, please add before each command the `--` to precise it's a command to fortress.
>
> e.g. `nix run github:/xavier2p/fortress -- --version`

```console
$ frtrs --help
A simple password safe CLI app

Usage: frtrs [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  create  Create a new vault
  copy    Copy the password of the desired identifier
  view    View the password of the desired identifier
  remove  Remove an entry from the vault
  add     Add a new entry to the vault. If no one of the password methods is provided, the password will be the content of the clipboard
  list    List all entries in the vault
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -f, --file <PATH>      The input file path [default: /tmp/vault.frt]
      --log-file <PATH>  Path to a file to write logs to [default: /tmp/fortress.log]
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

## Development

You must have Rust installed. See [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/) for more information.
All technical documentation is online, see [docs](https://xavier2p.github.io/fortress).

### Run tests

```sh
cargo test
```

### See Code Coverage

```sh
cargo tarpaulin
```

### Build and run

```sh
cargo build
cargo run
```

### Format code

```sh
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

## What we set up to make secure software

- We have some CI checks (tests, formatting, linting) running on each PR
- We run audit on dependencies weekly
- We use protected branches on GitHub, requiring reviews and all checks before merging

You can follow the development process via the issues and [project board](https://github.com/users/Xavier2p/projects/3)
on GitHub.
